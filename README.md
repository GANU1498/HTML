# HTML
Firstly HTML stands for Hyper-Text-Markup-Language.
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
A simple HTML code is Below:
<img width="689" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-07 172124" src="https://github.com/GANU1498/HTML/assets/143490640/f495571c-3f1f-4fc6-829c-262776407dc4">

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

The h1 element defines a large heading.
The p element defines a paragraph.
The DOCTYPE Declaration.
The DOCTYPE declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The DOCTYPE declaration is not case sensitive.

The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is:

<img width="633" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-07 173130" src="https://github.com/GANU1498/HTML/assets/143490640/7613dba6-2a13-4c32-837e-79e4ba2955e9">


HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
There is another important attribute of img tag that is'alt'.
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.


The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but We recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
All HTML elements can have attributes.
Attributes provide additional information about elements.
Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
The src Attribute---
the <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

In above image there are 3 Attributes src, width, height.
